# fonky-challenge
This is the assignment for developers who apply at Fonky.

When interviewing development positions, we believe it is important to see and discuss code. That's why we ask you to work on a challenge. It is not meant to take you too much time, but on the other hand it ways very heavily in the application process. 

The assignment is broadly formulated; it could take you weeks or days, but that's not the point. Don't worry about that, it's not about finishing it, but showing something that works and showing off your skills.

**The assignment**

In this repository you will find a folder Data containing orders.csv. This file contains Fonky's orders from different locations of one customer. Create a dashboard of the results for this customer. Here you can decide for yourself what you are presenting. Create a pull request in which you have included at least a readme that explains what you need to do to view the result.

**Creative freedom**

This assignment is deliberately broadly formulated. You may use the techniques and tools you prefer. You can spend your time on the aspects that are most important to you. There is no time to do everything: make a choice. At Fonky we work with Laravel and Vue. You are allowed to use frameworks and libraries. You may convert the data into another format or import it into databases. Then explain in the readme how someone else can get it working.

The minimum requirement in the assignment is "what are the results of this client for Fonky". That can be in a list, in a graphic form, it can be as numbers or colors. You can compare it with last week or an average score. Try to think of what is most important to Fonky.

**What we pay attention to**

- Design patterns
- OOP
- Consistency
- Think about what you want to showcase
- Check your code for mistakes before sending it (be self-critical)
- Quality over quantity
